Gemini's Deep Research post-completion flow now offers to pivot from its full report to an "infographic", in addition to an audio overview. (Infographic seems to mean a "@canvas" whose creation is guided by some additional hidden prompt.)

With a few rounds of edits + an uploaded napkin sketch image, I got to something that's more than good enough to use for a presentation tomorrow on "e" CQMS: https://lnkd.in/gAsEP-V5 . 

This was a *delightful* experience of progressive disclosure/opportunity, and I ended up somewhere much better than I expected.

Moral for now, I guess: say yes when AIs offer to do new things for you! You might like it, and you can hit undo if you don't(*).

"(*) Gemini's Web UX doesn't actually let you revert to a previous conversation turn the way Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, and Google's own AI Studio do. It's my one serious grievance with the product.
