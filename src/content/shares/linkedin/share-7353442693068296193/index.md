Big news: SMART Health Cards and Links is now a formal HL7 standard ðŸŽ‰

This standard gives people a simple, secure way to carry and share their health data using QR codes or copy/pasteable web links. Whether itâ€™s a summary of care, a digital insurance card, or a vaccine history for school, we now have a standardized, FHIR-based path forward.

To everyone who supported this work through the VCI back in 2021-2022: thank you! Your collaboration, energy, and willingness to build in the open helped get this off the ground and moving fast. This kind of adoption doesnâ€™t happen without people who care and who show up.

To Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy: your support and belief in open, implementable standards made this possible.

To Mark Roberts and the team at Leavitt Partners -- and most notably Frank McKinney -- thank you for guiding the editorial work and getting this through the HL7 process with clarity and persistence.

And to everyone who participated in driving this forward through the Argonaut Project and through HL7's FHIR Core Workgroup: Thank you! The rigorous review and feedback has been invaluable.

This is a milestone. Onward, together!
