All of Your Health Data... Now With Less Faxing?

==> Welcome to "Fun with the CMS/ASTP/ONC RFI!" Each day for the next 3 weeks, I'll explore one policy recommendation from my RFI Response in a playful format.

Today's Policy Recommendation: Mandate Self-Service Electronic EHI Request Functionality in Certified Health IT

Full Recommendation: https://lnkd.in/gWtsCfKE

Today's Voice: The Stand-Up Comedian

---

Alright folks, tonight we're tackling health tech! We're here to talk about a recommendation to "Mandate Self-Service Electronic EHI Request Functionality in Certified Health IT."

This means certified Health IT must give patients an easy, electronic way to ask for ALL their health info. No more phones, paper forms, or carrier pigeons. Just click, get, track.

So, you want your health records, right? All of 'em. Your "Electronic Health Information" – sounds important! And it is! But how do you get it?
Right now, it’s like trying to get a secret recipe from a paranoid chef. 

"Can I have my data?"

"Sure! First, fill out this form… in triplicate. Then, fax it. Yes, FAX IT. What year is it? Doesn't matter! Find a fax machine. Maybe it’s next to the dinosaur exhibit at the museum."

"Then what?"

"Then… we'll call you. Maybe. Or send a raven. We're still working out the kinks."

It's absurd! You can order a pizza, track its every move from dough to door, with an app. But your own health data? Good luck, Magellan!
This policy recommendation is basically saying: "Hey, EHR systems! It's the 21st century! Can we get a button?" Just a simple, electronic, "Gimme My Data" button.

Imagine! You log into your patient portal. Boom! "Request Full EHI." You click it. Then, you can TRACK it.

"Status: Dr. Digital is compiling your bits and bytes."
"Status: Your EHI is ready for download!"

No more calling Brenda in records, who’s lovely, but has a stack of requests taller than her. No more wondering if your fax went through or if it's now decorating someone's hamster cage.

This isn't rocket surgery, folks. It's basic customer service. If I can manage my Netflix queue without a congressional hearing, I should be able to request my own dang health info with a click.

Let’s make "self-service" mean something other than "you're on your own, pal!" It's for US, the people whose data it IS. 

=> Wrapping Up: Seriously though, an electronic way to request our full health history should be a given.
