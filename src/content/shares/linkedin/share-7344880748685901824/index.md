Has anyone seen evidence that health data breaches are "fueling the data broker industry" as a Fox News article claims? It seems wildly implausible that legitimate data brokers would risk their businesses by purchasing stolen medical records. (To be clear, there are plenty of *legal* and gross pathways by which data brokers acquire health-relevant content.)
