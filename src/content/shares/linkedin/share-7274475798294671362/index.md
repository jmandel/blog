Presenting "Argonaut: Wrapped," our 2024 year-end review: https://lnkd.in/e-QKUyEA. We've packed a busy year into a tidy package -- discover what made our year-end charts! #HL7 #FHIR 

Here's a closer look at the projects we tackled in 2024:

*   Patient Access Brands: We simplified how patient-facing apps connect to health systems. We finalized the specification for User Facing Brands, enabling apps to display health system information and logos, and these are already being implemented in production.

*   Granular Controls: We refined data access controls for enhanced security and privacy. We published updated guidance on granular scopes in US Core 7, clarifying how different levels of access can be granted.

*   Detecting Reporting Changes and Subscriptions: We tackled the challenges of efficiently identifying data changes. We explored solutions to improve data synchronization and laid the groundwork for implementing real-time notifications via subscriptions.

*   Glucose Monitoring: We developed standards for integrating continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data into electronic health records. We created an implementation guide for sharing CGM data with EHRs.

*   Bulk Data Optimization: We improved how large datasets are shared for research, population health, and other use cases. We focused on optimizing performance for bulk data exports and introduced features like organizing output by patient and support for partial manifests.

*   US Core: We guided the evolution of the US Core Implementation Guide, a foundational standard for interoperability. We incorporated the latest USCDI version and updates like those for granular controls into the guide, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for developers.

*   International Patient Access: We expanded our impact globally, working towards seamless patient data access across borders. We developed a website to promote the International Patient Access (IPA) specification and began building a directory of organizations and apps that support it.
