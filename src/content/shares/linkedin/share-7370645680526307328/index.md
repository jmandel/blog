A kraken clutchin’ me keel" (!!)  -- working on a clinical note synthesizer, I borrowed a variation of the old "talk like a pirate" trope to test out, uh, steerability.

Prompt:

> 52yo woman with recent exertional chest pain, she is an actual sea pirate captain

I kind of adore this paragraph from the synthesized HPI:

"> Due to prolonged maritime deployments and limited access to shore-based medical services, she has not previously sought evaluation. Onboard management included rest and rum, with minimal symptomatic relief—prompting her to dock for formal assessment. She describes the sensation as “a kraken clutchin’ me keel,” emphasizing its central, constricting quality. No known prior episodes of acute coronary syndrome or cardiac interventions.
