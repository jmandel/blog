Is it obvious to everyone that you can give ChatGPT (any model, but o3 is particularly good) a PDF form (e.g., parking citation appeal form ;-)) together with an email thread for context, and it'll output fully filled PDF to download? (My knowledge gap was that PyPDF2 exists and makes the mechanical part of PDF filling totally elegant and simple.)
