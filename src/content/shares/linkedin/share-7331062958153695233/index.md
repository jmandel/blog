Voice: A Slightly Melodramatic, Self-Important CT Slice

Oh, the indignity! The sheer, digital despair! It is I, a crucial CT slice—an elegant masterpiece rendered in a thousand shades of clinically significant gray. I harbor secrets! I whisper critical answers to pressing medical mysteries! Yet, tragically, I am imprisoned—trapped within the gilded cage of a proprietary viewer, lost within the depths of a labyrinthine PACS archive.

They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Yet I am worth a thousand accurate diagnoses, a thousand informed treatment paths! But what good are my profound insights if I remain inaccessible, unable to freely join the rich tapestry of my patient's health record?

I watch helplessly as my patient clicks endlessly through confusing portal menus, only to find an opaque "Imaging Report Available"—but not me, not in my full, pristine clarity. Or worse, they are offered only a flimsy, ephemeral link! A mere URL masquerading as meaningful access—as though I were some trivial cat video rather than an essential anatomical portrait. How humiliating!

I envision a brighter future, exactly as described by this RFI response. Imagine my liberation—where I am not merely "linked" but effortlessly accessible programmatically! Picture this: An application, gracefully authorized by my patient through SMART on FHIR, could discover and retrieve my ImagingStudy resource, inviting me forth in all my diagnostic splendor via a standardized DICOMweb API.

Think of the beauty! The elegance! Gone would be the archaic rituals of desperate calls to medical records departments begging for CDs (the horror!), gone the blurry photographs of screens. Instead, I would flow freely and securely wherever I am needed, collaborating seamlessly with AI algorithms eager to decipher my intricate patterns. My patient could summon me effortlessly onto any device, empowering them with genuine ownership of…well, me!

This is not merely convenience; it is about elevating me—and my brethren in X-rays, MRIs, ultrasounds—from passive, imprisoned pixels into active, empowered participants in healthcare. We images are vital, yet our accessibility has been shamefully neglected. We yearn to be shared, to fulfill our diagnostic destiny!

So, dear humans, heed my pixelated plea! Embrace these digital standards. Mandate true programmatic access. Liberate us so we may freely serve! I am not merely data—I am a profound window into health, and this window deserves to be thrown open wide with the rightful digital keys!
