Digital exhaust, carbon fixation, and  your health data: Every time you visit a healthcare provider, invisible signals radiate across digital networks, silently revealing where you went, who you saw, and when. This "digital exhaust" leaks patient privacy into the atmosphere of health information networks, accumulating unseen—but not without consequence.

Ideally, we'd avoid generating this exhaust entirely—much like avoiding fossil fuels through cleaner network designs and stronger privacy requirements. But given that today’s health networks routinely produce these privacy leaks, we should at least consider capturing and crystallizing this data, turning it into a clear, secure record individuals can use themselves.

In nature, plants address atmospheric CO₂ through carbon fixation, converting harmful emissions into stored energy and structure. Technologically, carbon fixation methods similarly capture and securely store pollutants, making them available for productive reuse.

We could apply a similar principle to health data: capturing the invisible digital exhaust and transforming it into a hardened, transparent access record that patients themselves control and benefit from.

Imagine a concise, human-readable "access statement":

1. Who requested your health records
2. When the request was made
3. What information was accessed or requested
4. Why the data was requested (treatment, insurance, public health)
5. Contact information for questions or concerns

Such a record doesn't require reinventing our current systems. The raw materials already flow through existing health data infrastructure. The critical step is capturing these diffuse leaks and clearly presenting them back to the patients they concern.

"True privacy protection also means revisiting our "opt-out" mechanisms. Today's typical opt-out merely blocks data responses, yet still broadcasts patient presence. A more effective approach would prevent unnecessary queries altogether, except when legally or medically justified.
