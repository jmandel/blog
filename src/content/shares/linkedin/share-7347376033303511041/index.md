Coverage Commons empowers you to turn an insurance denial into a winning appeal by using the insurer's own secret rules against them, then shares those anonymized rules with everyone to build a public knowledge base ðŸ“¤.

Here is a free... uh, business?... idea. It doesn't make any money as far as I can tell, but It would be a useful form of consumer empowerment.
