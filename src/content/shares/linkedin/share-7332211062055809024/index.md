With Pocket shutting down, I got Claude 4 to build me a GitHub-backed alternative (simple links.md file bootstrapped from Pocket export csv... & GH Actions JS to build a static site). Plus an Android app to receive link shares, apply tags, and append links.md on GitHub.

Bonus features:

* Parse and render JSON LD from sites that have it
* Resurrect dead links from Wayback Machine
"* LLM-mediated JSON-LD generation from raw HTML of the resurrected links
