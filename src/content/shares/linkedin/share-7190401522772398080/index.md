I'm excited to be participating in the FHIR® Access Control Meetup on April 30th! The meetup will explore real-world challenges and solutions around authorization in FHIR.

I'll be presenting rapid-fire on three topics under the theme "Authorization: Easy and Hard".

🔒 SMART v2: I'll review today's granular scope language, then discuss limitations and next steps. We'll explore the challenges of authorizing access to FHIR custom operations and the path toward element-level permissions.

🔗 SMART Health Links: I'll touch on this new, simple way to share targeted health data directly with apps and trusted individuals. I'll show an example using my own continuous glucose monitoring data. 

🌐 TEFCA: As data sharing expands across organizations, B2B exchange practices are coming under well-deserved scrutiny.  It's critical for TEFCA to offer transparency and controls for patients.

Privacy and security are paramount as FHIR adoption grows.
