"[This will kill people](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshuamandel.com%2Fregulations.gov-comment-browser%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0001%2F%23%2Fcomments%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-4555)."

A physician at a community health center said this. He wasn't being dramatic.

"[I’m sick to my stomach](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshuamandel.com%2Fregulations.gov-comment-browser%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0001%2F%23%2Fcomments%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0148)," wrote another provider, "knowing I have to turn away my patients because of their 'legal status.' That will forever mean nothing to me."

A new rule asks healthcare providers to violate our oldest promise: First, do no harm. It pits the law against our professional, ethical, and human duty. The response from the front lines of care has been a unanimous roar of refusal.

We were taught to treat need, not status. A physician with 35 years of experience stated, "[In medical school, I was never taught to differentiate the quality of the care provided to patients because of their background](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshuamandel.com%2Fregulations.gov-comment-browser%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0001%2F%23%2Fcomments%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-7617)." This rule orders us to unlearn our fundamental training. It commands us to betray our oaths.

This is more than a logistical problem. It is a moral wound. Providers use words like "heartbreak," "cruel," and "unconscionable." They speak of "moral injury"—the soul-deep distress of being forced to act against your conscience. "[If I had to turn people away](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshuamandel.com%2Fregulations.gov-comment-browser%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0001%2F%23%2Fcomments%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0250)," one said, "I wouldn't do this job. The moral injury would be too significant."

The rule tries to turn healers into immigration agents. We are trained to provide care, not "[vet legal status](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshuamandel.com%2Fregulations.gov-comment-browser%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0001%2F%23%2Fcomments%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-4578)." Our clinics are meant to be sanctuaries for health, not outposts for enforcement. One provider asked, "[At what point...do I become an immigration officer instead of a healer?](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshuamandel.com%2Fregulations.gov-comment-browser%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0001%2F%23%2Fcomments%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-4672)"

This breaks more than our spirit. It shatters the foundation of public health: trust. When a clinic becomes a place of fear, everyone stays away. Citizens. Non-citizens. The sick. The contagious. A health center warned the rule "[will erode decades of trust-building in communities](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshuamandel.com%2Fregulations.gov-comment-browser%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0001%2F%23%2Fcomments%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-5664)." Effective public health becomes impossible.

Moral injury leads to burnout. Burnout leads to exodus. Providers are saying they will leave their jobs, or the profession entirely, before they comply. The policy will cripple the very clinics built to serve the vulnerable, worsening the healthcare shortages that already plague our nation.

This is not an abstract policy debate. It is a question of our humanity. A social worker in Arizona, having seen people die from heat stroke, wrote that this rule "[brings tears to my eyes, since I am already able to visualize the mortal consequences](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshuamandel.com%2Fregulations.gov-comment-browser%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0001%2F%23%2Fcomments%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0287)."

Another family doctor’s plea says it all.

"[Do not condemn my patients, my coworkers, and my friends to suffering and death](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshuamandel.com%2Fregulations.gov-comment-browser%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0001%2F%23%2Fcomments%2FAHRQ-2025-0002-0291)."
