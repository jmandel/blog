The Rural Health Transformation Program (part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Public Law 119–21) dedicates $50 billion over five years. States must apply by the end of 2025 with a detailed plan. CMS will distribute half the money equally across approved states and half using a formula based on rural population, facility counts, and hospital solvency.

### Program mechanics
- Congress appropriated $10 billion per year for FY 2026 through 2030.

- Only the 50 states are eligible; there is no matching requirement.

- States must apply by December 31, 2025 with a Rural Health Transformation Plan. CMS must approve or deny applications by that date.

- Approved states remain eligible for funding across all five years, unless CMS finds misuse and withholds or recovers funds.

- CMS splits funding each year: half equally across approved states, half distributed by formula.

- The formula must ensure that at least one quarter of states receive a share. CMS is instructed to consider rural population (including Goldsmith-defined tracts), the number of rural facilities relative to national totals, the status of certain hospitals, and any other factors it deems appropriate.

- States must file annual reports, and CMS has authority to withhold or recover funds if use diverges from the approved plan.

- There is no administrative or judicial review of CMS’s allocation or recovery decisions.

- Funds are time-limited. States must spend them by the end of the following fiscal year. Beginning in 2028, CMS redistributes unspent balances. All funds must be returned to Treasury by October 1, 2032.

### Restrictions on useStates must down less than 10% on administrative expenses. They must certify that no funds will be used for intergovernmental transfers, certified public expenditures, or to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid or CHIP. Beyond that, the money can be directed into any of ten categories, with the requirement that each state select at least three.

### The ten eligible activities
- Evidence-based interventions for prevention and chronic disease management

- Payments to providers for health care services, as CMS specifies

- Consumer-facing technology for prevention and chronic disease management

- Training and technical assistance for adopting technology such as remote monitoring, robotics, or AI

- Recruiting and retaining clinicians in rural areas, with a minimum five-year service commitment

- Investments in IT, including software, hardware, and cybersecurity

- Helping communities right-size their delivery systems and decide which services to sustain

- Expanding access to substance use disorder and mental health services

- Developing innovative models of care, including value-based arrangements and alternative payment models

- Other uses determined by CMS to support sustainable rural health care

### Why it matters for interoperabilityThe structure of the program puts CMS in a strong steering role. Because half the funding is formula-driven and CMS decides what counts as acceptable provider payments or technology-enabled care, it can push states toward investments that expand interoperability. The ten eligible activities explicitly allow investments in IT and consumer tools, which means states can choose to support data exchange networks or FHIR-based APIs. This makes the program a potential sequel to HITECH, but with broader goals: not just EHR adoption, but real connectivity across rural systems.

### The role for conversational interoperabilityAI is included in the statute as one of the technologies that states can support. I'm keen to see whether this funding will drive expansion of “conversational interoperability,” where AI agents act as mediators between systems. Instead of a rural clinician or patient manually logging into multiple payor or disease registry portals, an AI agent could query external systems, reconcile data, and present results through a natural interface. These tools would could work even in engineers with limited support for standards-based interoperability. The program’s flexibility creates space for states to experiment with this model, layering conversational interfaces on top of ad hoc infrastructure.

### Closing thoughtThe Rural Health Transformation Program is more than a bailout for rural hospitals. With $50 billion on the table, it is a lever for system redesign. States have to choose their activities carefully, and CMS has the discretion to set priorities through its formula and oversight. If both emphasize interoperability, IT, and forward-looking models, rural providers could finally be fully connected to the national health data fabric. If not, the money risks patching holes without building durable infrastructure. The opportunity is here; the outcome depends on how states and CMS decide to use it.
